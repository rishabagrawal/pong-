## Personal Learning
* Debugging and understanding the error occuring while coding 
* How orders matters in javascript especially in pong. 
* Naming variables correctly and commenting in the end brackets so it makes sense when I return to them.
* Try to have fun, take breaks, and not always be serious in completing projects. 
## Stretch Goal 
* PauseDial - when we pause the game and press the up or down arrow. The paddles would generally move however in this situation it stays in the place as you have left it. 
* Declaring a winner- a failed attempt at first, i went on score file gave a variable that winning score is 5 then went to game file wrote a if statement that player 1 and player 2 reaches the winning score, wins however that caused errors. Causing the game to disappear therefore i removed this stretch goal. Second attempt with instructor we were successful. We went to ball.js created a if statement after the player.score. Then we added location.relaod so the game sets back instead of getting stuck in the loop of giving alerts. Therefore continue with a new round of game.
